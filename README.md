Movie Data Analysis for the Next Movie Selection in a Budget of a Hypothetical Production Firm 

The project is the assignment of Data Science Research Method Module at Sussex University,

Instructions are as follows:

You are employed as a data scientist at SussexBudgetProductions. The last movie produced by the company was a comedy-action-thriller with a budget of £500K. It failed at the box office and only grossed £100K. So to keep the production company in business, the next film needs to make money. The CEO thinks they can persuade investors to give £1.5 million in funding over the next year, but needs to ensure a good return. Therefore, they have asked you to analyse the IMDB data provided in the movie metadata.csv Download metadata.csv file and come up with an actionable plan. You should assume that all budgets in the data file have been converted to GBP. 

Your submission should contain details relating to the following three issues:

Exploratory data analysis you have carried out with the IMDB data.
Hypotheses that you have designed relating to the overall aim of this assignment and the experiments that you have carried out to test whether they are supported by the data.
Actionable recommendations based on the analyses you have conducted.
For this assessment you are asked to submit a Jupyter notebook which summarises your analysis of a real world dataset using appropriate tools and techniques.
